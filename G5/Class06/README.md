# Let's build Country encyclopedia 📚🏴
## Phases of building an app 🏗
Applications are not built only by coding and drinking coffee. Applications are also built by thinking, researching, planning and testing. All these things are called a development cycle of an application.  Today we are going to build an application. These are the phases that we are going to pass:
* Analyzing and researching
* Planning and discussion
* Coding the planned features
* Testing the code that we have written

### Analyzing and research phase 🔹
We need to make a single page application that will serve as a country encyclopedia:
It needs to have one table that will display the data about the countries:

* Country Info - A table that shows info about countries from the whole world
	* Flag
  * Country name
  * Capital city
  * Area ( km2 )
  * Population
  * Region

#### About the API 🛰
We will be using the [REST COUNTRIES](https://restcountries.eu/) API. This API is free. You can find out on in the API documentation page all the endpoints available for use. Here are some useful endpoints that we will use:
* **API:** https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2

* **All countries link:** https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all ( returns 250 results)

* **Country by name:** https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/macedonia ( returns only one country )

### Planning phase 🔹
In this step we already analysed the stuff that we need and the requirements for the application. Now we have to plan it. Planning is one of the most important part of the development process. We take the whole problem of building the app and create smaller chunks or tasks that we can complete. 

1. Plann the folder structure of your project
2. Create HTML page and connect a script, css document and libraries
3. Plann initialy how the components will be displayed on the site
4. Research the API documentation of how to make a request
5. Make a research of how to display all the data using pagination
6. Research all the extra things that needs to be added
9. Create a logic for getting, displaying and filtering the data
10. Start coding! 😎

### Coding phase 🔹
In this phase we start coding all the tasks that we have planned and written in the planning phase. So we are building and creating the application here. We can always go back and add a task in the planning list if we encounter some feature that we missed in the planning. 

### Testing phase 🔹
This is a phase where we spend time testing our code and checking if the built product correlates with the requirements. When we encounter a problem, missing requirement or something out of place we go back to the coding phase to fix the problems and then go back to testing. This cycle is done when we are satisfied with the complete product.
