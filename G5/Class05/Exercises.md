# [Exercise 01]

Write a function that takes an array of strings.
The function should print out every element in the console alongside its index number.
Hint: Notice the callback function input parameters. The first parameter is the value of every element in the array.
The second parameter is the index number itself.

arrayOfStrings.forEach((element, index) => {

})

# [Exercise 02]

Write a function that takes an array as an input parameter.
The function should then concatenate the elements of the array and print them out in the console.
Bonus: Make the result appear as a paragraph in the DOM
Hint: Also check out the .join() method. :)

# [Exercise 03]

Write a function that takes an array of strings as an input parameter.

# [Exercise 04]

Write a fetch call that makes a GET request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
Then take the resulting array of objects and add a new property called age
that will be a random number between 18 and 80 to every object in the array.

Hint: You can generate the age with Math.floor((Math.random() \* 62) + 18);
