# Homework

Make two http requests to some of the APIs that we covered on the class!

### Task 1:
* Create a button and attach event listener to it. When clicked the button
should make an API call by using AJAX and print in the console the data taken from the API source.

### Task 2:
* Create another button and attach another event listener to it. When clicked
the button should make an API call by using fetsh() method and print in the console the data taken from the API source.


#### Bonus
Display the data into an HTML table or layout by your choice! Be creative ðŸ˜Ž
